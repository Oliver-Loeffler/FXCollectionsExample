# FXCollectionsExample

A small example showing how bindings can be used and how FXCollections can be used.

## How to run:

* clone the repository: https://github.com/Oliver-Loeffler/FXCollectionsExample.git
* run the build
* execute the program

To run the example via Bash:

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Oliver-Loeffler/FXCollectionsExample.git
$ cd FXCollectionsExample
$ ./gradlew build
$ ./gradlew runJfx
```

On Windows the commands are the same, exact the Gradle-Wrapper call. Here both tasks (`build`, `jfxRun`) are called in one line.

```Cmd
> gradlew build runJfx
```

In case of questions, feel free to ask!
